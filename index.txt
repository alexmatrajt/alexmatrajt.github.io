About me

I'm Creative Director and UI/UX Designer from Sydney, Australia, working in web development and print media. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

My job is to build your website so that it is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive. Moreover, I add personal touch to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use. My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way. I created web design for many famous brand companies.


I’m a data scientist from Mexico City, currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Business Analytics at the University of San Diego’s Rady School of Management. I previously earned a B.S. in Data Science with a Minor in Asian Languages and Cultures (Mandarin) from the University of Michigan.

I’m passionate about combining technical rigor with strategic thinking to solve real-world problems — particularly in areas like [insert your specific interests: e.g. AI applications, marketing analytics, or sustainable business solutions].

I'm currently seeking [a full-time role / internship / consulting opportunities] where I can contribute my skills in data science, research, and business strategy to drive meaningful impact.
